# Shadertoy
(Will be) a desktop equivalent to https://shadertoy.com.

Currently a good demo for wgpu-rs

### Shaders
Shaders are written with GLSL (`#version 460`) and recompiled
automatically to SPIR-V when changed.

### TODO
 - Runtime shader compilation
 - Live reloading shaders
 - Bind uniforms (time and other params)
 - Bind resources (like textures)
 - CLI
 - GUI
